# VF4-and-DDFV-for-anisotropic-diffusion-problem
MATLAB version of SCILAB code by Prof. Stella Krell: https://math.unice.fr/~krell/index.php?page=CodeScilab

After executing, the code produces vtk files which could be imported in Paraview.
User needs to open approximate_solution_1.vtk and approximate_solution_2.vtk simutaneously to see the overall countour of the solution.
Bearing in mind that you need at least MATLAB R2012b to run the code. MATLAB 6.5 would not work.
In order to run the code, simply executing VF_2D.m which is the main program of the 2D code.
